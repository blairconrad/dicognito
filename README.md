Dicognito is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) module and command-line utility that anonymizes
[DICOM](https://www.dicomstandard.org/) files.

Use it to anonymize one or more DICOM files belonging to one or any number of patients. Objects will remain grouped
in their original patients, studies, and series.

The package is [available on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/dicognito/) and can be installed from the command line by typing

```
pip install dicognito
```

## Anonymizing from the command line

Once installed, a `dicognito` command will be added to your Python scripts directory.
You can run it on entire filesystem trees or a collection of files specified by glob like so:

```
dicognito .      # recurses down the filesystem, anonymizing all found DICOM files
dicognito *.dcm  # anonymizes all files in the current directory with the dcm extension
```

Files will be anonymized in place, with significant attributes, such as identifiers, names, and
addresses, replaced by random values. Dates and times will be shifted a random amount, but their
order will remain consistent within and across the files.

Get more help via `dicognito --help`.

## Anonymizing from within Python

To anonymize a bunch of DICOM objects from within a Python program, import the objects using
[pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io/) and use the `Anonymizer` class:

```python
import pydicom
import dicognito.anonymizer

anonymizer = dicognito.anonymizer.Anonymizer()

for original_filename in ("original1.dcm", "original2.dcm"):
    with pydicom.dcmread(original_filename) as dataset:
        anonymizer.anonymize(dataset)
        dataset.save_as("clean-" + original_filename)
```

Use a single `Anonymizer` on datasets that might be part of the same series, or the identifiers will not be
consistent across objects.
